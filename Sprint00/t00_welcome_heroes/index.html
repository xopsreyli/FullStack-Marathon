    <h2 id="section1">What makes a superhero?</h2>
    <p><b>A superhero is a person who does heroic deeds and has the ability to do them in a way that a normal person
        couldn’t.</b> So in order to be a superhero, you need a power that is more exceptional than any power a normal human
        being could possess, and you need to use that power to accomplish good deeds. Otherwise, a policeman or a fireman
        could be considered a superhero. <br>For instance, a good guy fighting a bad guy could be just a regular police story or
        detective story or human-interest story. But if it’s a good guy with a superpower who is fighting a bad guy, it
        becomes a superhero story. <i>If the good guy is doing something that a normal human being couldn’t do, couldn’t
            accomplish, then I assume he becomes a superhero.</i>
